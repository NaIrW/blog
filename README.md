I lost my secret key, so now I only publish blogs by directly accessing the database.

Here is the address for some of the secret blogs: `80d6e72991b26d5b11d393824c44e13863d62c0fd0a6741d69680230cbb54877`.

There might be some things you wonder about.

It's really just a collection of random musings. As you read, please keep the historical limitations in mind.

Thank you for coming here and reading my nonsense.

And in case I don't see you: good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.
